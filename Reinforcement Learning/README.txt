Reinforcement learning and Inverse Reinforcement learning

In the first part of this project, we will find the optimal policy of a single 
agent navigating in a 2-D environment. To solve the problem, we first create 
the Markov Decision Process by setting up the state-space, action set, transition 
probabilities, discount factor, and reward function in Python and emply Value 
Iteration Algorithm to solve the project.

In the second part, the task is extracting an expert's reward function by observing 
the optimal policy of the expert, which is inverse reinforcement learning. Here, we 
adopt Linear Programming formulation algorithm to solve IRL problem.
