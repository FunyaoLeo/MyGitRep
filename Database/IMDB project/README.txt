IMDB Project

This project is to build a Web site on movies, actors and their reviews, supported 
by a relational database system. The system manages all of its data at the back-end 
in a MySQL database and provides a Web interface to the users at the front-end. To 
develop this project we will use the MySQL DBMS and the Linux operating system. We 
will also use the PHP programming language to access MySQL and the Apache2 Web 
server to provide a Web interface.
