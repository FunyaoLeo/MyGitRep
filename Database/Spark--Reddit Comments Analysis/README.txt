Spark--Reddit Comments Analysis

The project is to parse and sanitize the Reddit comments with Python into unigrams, bigrams 
and trigrams. Then we will use different kinds of database operations like join,find, etc. 
in spark to massage the data into the proper format for training a sentiment classifier (Spark MLLib). 
At last evaluate the model and plot ROC graph.
