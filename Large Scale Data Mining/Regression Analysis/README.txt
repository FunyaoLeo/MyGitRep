Regression Analysis

Introduction:  We use a Network backup Dataset, which is comprised of simulated traffic data on a 
backup system over a network. The goal is to predict the backup size of a file given the other 
attributes.We need use several regression models to accomplish the goal, such as Linear Regression, 
Polynomial Regression and Neural Network Regression models. Through using cross validation and 
regularization, we can also further improve the prediction result from the datasets.
