Collaborative Filtering

In this project, we built a recommender system for the MovieLens dataset. 
Based on multiple users, movies and the movie rating information, we are able to give 
out movies recommendation for users. We built recommendation system using collaborative 
filtering methods. The basic idea of collaborative filtering methods is that these 
unspecified ratings can be imputed because the observed ratings are often highly correlated 
across various users and items.  We will implement and analyze the performance of two types
 of collaborative filtering methods: Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering and 
 Model-based collaborative filtering.
