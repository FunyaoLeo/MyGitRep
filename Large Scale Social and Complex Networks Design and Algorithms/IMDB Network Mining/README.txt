IMDB Network Mining

In this project, we will study the various properties of Internet Movie
Database (IMDb). In the first part of the project, we will explore the
properties of a directed actor/actress network. In the second part of the
project, we will explore the properties of an undirected movie network.
At last, we will utilize the properties we explore to predict ratings of some
of movies.
