Facebook and Google+ Network Mining

In this project, we will study the various properties of social networks.
First is an undirected social network and second is a directed social network 
(Google +). At last, we will try to solve friend recommendation in personalized
networks of Facebook with common neighbor measure, Jaccard measure and Adamic-Adar
measure. The result returns around 80% accuracy in friend recommendation.
