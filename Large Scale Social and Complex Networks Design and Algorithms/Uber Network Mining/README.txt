Uber Network Mining

In this project, we download travelling data during a certain time period from 
"Uber Movement" website. Then we construct the weighted graph and try to solve "travelling
salesman problem" on this network. We apply the 2-approximate algorithm to find
an approximate solution to this NP problem. We also calculate the empirical 
performance of this algorithm against a baseline: twice the summation of all 
the weights of  minimum spanning tree. At last we plot the trajectory that 2-approximate
algorithm presented as our solution to the problem.
