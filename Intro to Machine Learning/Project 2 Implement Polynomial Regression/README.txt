Implement Linear and Polynomial Regression

In this project, we will further open the "black-box" and implemnt linear and polynomial regression
model from the mathmatical theory. Also implment Gradient Descent Method to solve the regression 
model, with Root Mean Square Error measuring how degree influences the result of polynomial 
regssion.
