Facial Recoginition

In this project, we will investigate facial recognition, which can be treated as a clustering problem.
We will use a small part of a huge database of faces of famous people (Labeled Faces in the Wild [LFW]
people dataset.

First we will adopt PCA to reconstruct images. Then explore how K-Means and K-Medoids perform on this
task. At last, cluster the images and measure the average cluster purity.
