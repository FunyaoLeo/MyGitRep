Twitter analysis using SVMs

In this project, we will be working with Twitter data. Specifically, a number of tweets that are 
reviews/reactions to movies are supplied.

We will learn to automatically classify such tweets as either positive or negative reviews. To do
this, we will employ Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a popular choice for a large number of
classification problems.
