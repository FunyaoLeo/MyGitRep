Applying decision trees on Titanic Survival

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, killing 1502 out
of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that
there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck
involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, 
such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this problem, we will complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.
In particular, we will apply the tools of decision tree to predict which passengers survived
the tragedy.
