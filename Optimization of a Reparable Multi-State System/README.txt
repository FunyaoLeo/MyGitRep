Optimization of a Reparable Multi-State System

In this optimal control design for the reparable system project, the final goal is to make the probability of a 
device in good mode approach 90%, the probability of the same device in failed mode approach 10% and the sum of 
control inputâ€™s abstract value should be as small as possible. The problem has first been transformed to a standard 
quadratic problem. Then analytical solution and Lagrange algorithm have been applied to solve this problem. At last, 
with the help of MATLAB, these two methods return the same optimized answer.
